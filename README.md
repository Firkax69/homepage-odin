# homepage-odin

@Implemented picture with source and srcset parameters with zoomIn and zoomOut effect.
@Used transform property for front avatar movement and changes.
@Responsivness: in my projects always start with the mobile  experience and then use media-queries for layout expansion. All is working as it should.
@Icons were downloaded as SVGs from https://materialdesignicons.com/.
@Used font font-family: "Nunito", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
@All photos and photoscreens are original! But feel free to use it for your purposes. (Unless it will lead to reputation harm! Please be considerate)
